# Databases-DAD220-
Please review the attached document, titled [Create A Database](https://github.com/JessicaDuft/Databases-DAD220-/blob/main/Create_A_Database.docx), to see how I built an RMA inventory database using SQL in DAD220 at SNHU.
<br/>
This course was an introduction to SQL which sparked my interest so much that I advanced my SQL skills independently after taking this course.
<br/>
I was later able to use this knowledge professionally to write advanced queries to pull important data from local databases. I do not want to post the queries I have written for security purposes, but using MSSQL I wrote queries that allowed myself and my team to determine if the client's server was fully backed up before they swapped to a new server. Doing so prevented loss of data when the client upgraded or replaced their server.
